WeMoGlass
=========
WeMoGlass is an application for controlling Belkin WeMo devices through Google Glass.
Note that when the application scans for devices, it does not find them all immediately. If all of your devices do not show up, refresh and they should appear. 
Currently, you are only able to turn on or off a device. To do so, when prompted, one would say Turn Off <Device Name> or Turn On <Device Name>. Device Name is the name that you gave it when you set it up. To find out the name, you can view it from within the app. 
To trigger the app, say Okay Glass, Wemo. 
When you first use the trigger phrase, it will scan for devices. If you use thet trigger phrase and the app is already running, it will prompt for voice input to turn on or off a device.
